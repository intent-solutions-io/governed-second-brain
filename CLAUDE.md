# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

The **umbrella / landing repo** for **Governed Second Brain** — the local-first knowledge stack
built on the *compile, then govern* architecture. (Renamed from `compile-then-govern` on
2026-06-16; the GitHub repo is now `intent-solutions-io/governed-second-brain` and the old URL
auto-redirects. The local working directory is still `compile-then-govern/`.) It contains
ecosystem-level documentation only — **no application code, no build, no tests, no lint.** The
entire repo is `README.md` plus a handful of governance files (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
`LICENSE`) and `assets/` (banner + social-card SVG/PNG). `.github/` is intentionally empty (CI
badges in the README point at the flagship repos' workflows, not this one).

The single deliverable here is the README: it explains what the components are, how they stack,
and why the architecture beats vector stores / agent-memory layers. Treat the README as the
product.

## Where the Code Actually Lives

This repo is just the map. Code, issues, PRs, test gates, and security reports belong in the
flagship repos:

| Repo | Layer | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| [`intentional-cognition-os`](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/intentional-cognition-os) (ICO) | **Compile** | Local-first knowledge OS. Deterministic kernel (SQLite + JSONL) + probabilistic compiler (Claude). 6 compiler passes → emits a governance spool. |
| [`qmd-team-intent-kb`](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/qmd-team-intent-kb) (INTKB) | **Govern** | Deterministic control plane. Consumes ICO's spool, runs dedupe → policy → promotion, append-only audit log. |
| [`qmd`](https://github.com/tobi/qmd) (by @tobi) | **Retrieve** | On-device hybrid search (BM25 + vector + LLM rerank). Pinned upstream dependency; every result is a `qmd://` citation. |

Per `CONTRIBUTING.md`: code/feature PRs go to the flagship repos. Only **ecosystem-level doc
fixes** (this README, the dependency map, the status table, the diagrams) belong here.

## The Architecture Thesis (why the README says what it says)

Understanding the wording matters more than any file structure here. The whole pitch rests on
one constraint:

> **The model proposes; the deterministic system owns durable state and control.**

- **Compile, don't index** — ICO *derives* knowledge (summaries, concepts, contradictions, gaps),
  keeping raw and derived strictly separate with provenance from the first byte.
- **Govern by code, not by model** — dedupe, policy, secret-detection, trust levels, tenant
  isolation, and promotion are deterministic in INTKB's kernel. The model never writes durable
  state directly.
- **Receipts are the wedge** — the differentiator vs. the "AI memory" category is not better
  recall, it's a **tamper-evident, SHA-256 hash-chained audit trail** (`prev_hash` per JSONL
  event) plus inline `qmd://` citations, verifiable after the fact via `ico audit verify`.

When editing the README, preserve this framing: the competitive axis is **govern + receipts**,
not recall. Don't soften "deterministic," "append-only," or "hash-chained" into vague
memory-marketing language — the precision is the point.

Equally, don't *over*claim. The chain is tamper-**evident** (detection of edits/reordering),
**not** tamper-proof: a local writer with write access can edit an event *and* re-hash the chain
forward, and `ico audit verify` passes again. So the README carries a "What the receipt does
*not* do" trust-model box — local = integrity + ordering; cross-actor non-repudiation needs the
external chain-head anchor (sign via `git-exporter` / OpenTimestamps), which is on the roadmap and
gated before any cross-actor "tamper-evident" claim. Keep that box honest. **Forbidden words:**
tamper-proof, immutable, non-repudiation (for local mode), blockchain.

## Editing Conventions

- **Mermaid + dual-theme SVG banners**: the README embeds two Mermaid diagrams (a sequence flow
  and an architecture flowchart) with inline `%%{init...}%%` theme blocks, and a
  `<picture>`-switched dark/light banner. After editing either, verify rendering on the GitHub
  web view — there is no local preview build.
- **Assets are committed binaries/SVG** in `assets/`. The banner exists as both `.svg` (source of
  truth, referenced by the README) and `.png` (2x raster fallback, 2400×680); `social-card.*` is the
  1280×640 GitHub social preview. The SVGs carry live `<text>` — the product title is editable text,
  not outlined paths. Regenerate the PNGs if the SVG changes with **`rsvg-convert`** (NOT ImageMagick
  `convert`, whose internal renderer mangles the SVG fonts/gradients):
  `rsvg-convert -w 2400 -h 680 banner-dark.svg -o banner-dark.png` (social-card uses `-w 1280 -h 640`).
- **The thesis doc is byte-identical across repos**: *"Compile, Then Govern"* lives at
  `000-docs/034-AT-NTRP-ecosystem-thesis.md` in **both** flagships (not in this repo). If a claim
  in this README is sourced from it, keep them consistent.
- **Status table** (versions / licenses near the bottom of the README) drifts as the flagships
  release. Verify against the actual repo tags before changing version numbers.

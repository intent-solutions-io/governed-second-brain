# teamkb-quality-digest.sh — nightly GOVERN-QUALITY drift canary for the governed
# brain (bead compile-then-govern-e06.7). The teamkb-compile skill already emits a
# candidate/promotion digest and runs `brain_audit_verify` (honest 3-state since
# e06.2 — "0 tamper signatures, N benign forks", NOT a false TAMPER klaxon). This
# adds the QUALITY-DRIFT half: a cheap, read-only snapshot of the governed store
# that flags day-over-day drift — a governance backlog, a promotion stall, a
# supersession/churn spike — pushed to Slack #cron-failures on DRIFT (ntfy
# retired 2026-06-13) so the un-babysat loop is observable on QUALITY, not just
# liveness.
#
# Auto by default, ALERT on drift (not a raw dump) — consistent with the
# self-management doctrine. Standalone + idempotent; run it from cron or after the
# nightly compile. NEVER mutates ~/.teamkb (opens the DB read-only) and never fails
# loud — a broken canary must not take anything down.
#
# Usage:  teamkb-quality-digest.sh [--no-ntfy] [--json]
